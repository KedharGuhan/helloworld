maven is a build tool
it is a industry standard
very often, we will use libraries developed by others in our development

this is because there is no point in re-inventing the wheel

how do you include and build with other libraries?
use Maven

-------------

any questions?

no.. it is a format.. we specify what we want, and it will download the necessary files

----------
ok , so , in java, whatever we build, if we want to expose it, it is called a jar file

-----
 to make it usable by others

----
thats the advantage of java, you build it once and it can be run anywhere, system independent

---
yes, but you will have to build it again and then run it
---

not in java, thats because java is a runtime. it is a container kinda thing. a virtual machine.

---

turbo c++ thats a compiler

----

ya, its like a JVM has its own thing.  jus read about JVM

---


will jsut show you how maven is
